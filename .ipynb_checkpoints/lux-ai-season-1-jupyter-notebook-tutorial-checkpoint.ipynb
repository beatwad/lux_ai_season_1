    "# Lux AI Season 1 Python Tutorial Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Lux AI Season 1!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is the basic setup to use Jupyter Notebooks and the `kaggle-environments` package to develop your bot. If you plan to not use Jupyter Notebooks or any other programming language, please see our [Github](https://github.com/Lux-AI-Challenge/Lux-Design-2021). The following are some important links!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Competition Page: https://www.kaggle.com/c/lux-ai-2021/\n",
    "\n",
    "- Online Visualizer: https://2021vis.lux-ai.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "- Specifications: https://www.lux-ai.org/specs-2021\n",
    "\n",
    "- Github: https://github.com/Lux-AI-Challenge/Lux-Design-2021\n",

    "- Bot API: https://github.com/Lux-AI-Challenge/Lux-Design-2021/tree/master/kits\n",
    "\n",
    "And if you haven't done so already, we **highly recommend** you join our Discord server at https://discord.gg/aWJt3UAcgn or at the minimum follow the kaggle forums at https://www.kaggle.com/c/lux-ai-2021/discussion. We post important announcements there such as changes to rules, events, and opportunities from our sponsors!\n",

    "Now let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that you have a basic knowledge of Python and programming. It's okay if you don't know the game specifications yet! Feel free to always refer back to https://www.lux-ai.org/specs-2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "First thing to verify is that you have **Node.js v12 or above**. The engine for the competition runs on Node.js (for many good reasons including an awesome visualizer) and thus it is required. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). You can then verify you have the appropriate version by running\n"

    "- Mining resources near your opponent's citytiles so they have less easy access to resources\n",
    "- Using carts to deliver resources from far away clusters of wood, coal, uranium to a city in need\n",
    "- Sending worker units over to the opponent's roads and pillaging them to slow down their agent\n",
    "- Optimizing over how much to mine out of forests before letting them regrow so you can build more cities and get sustainable fuel"
